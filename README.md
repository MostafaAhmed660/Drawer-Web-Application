*how we have applied the required design pattern*

 1. We used Shape Factory design pattern: Service Class is the shape factory for shapes to generate shapes and to make any operation on shapes(delete, copyâ€¦).
 2. We used singleton design pattern: to do only one object of service class .
 3.We wanted to use prototype design pattern on shapes to make copy of them.
But that causes a problem in frontend; it makes (flicker problem).
So, we made a copy of our shapes in the frontend to be more efficient for the user.
